<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
     The <B>vm</B> utility is used to provide simplified management of	<B>bhyve(8)</B> vir-
     tual machines, including networking and console access.

     Networking	is handled by creating one or more virtual switches. Each
     switch has	a simple name which is referenced in the virtual machine con-
     figuration	file.  The <B>vm</B> utility automatically creates a <B>bridge(4)</B>	device
     for each virtual switch and assigns virtual machine <B>tap(4)</B>	interfaces
     dynamically.

     All configuration for virtual machines is stored in a simple rc style
     configuration file. When virtual machines are first created, the configu-
     ration file is copied from	a template which can be	specified by the user.
     Multiple templates	can be created providing an easy way to	provision
     guests with specific configurations.
	   <font color=\"green\">vm_enable="YES"  - <b>DONE, Extension do it</b></font>
	   <font color=\"green\">vm_dir="/mnt/PATH/TO/vm_bhyve"     - <b>DONE, Extension do it</b></font>
	   vm_list=""
	   vm_delay="5"

     The first and second lines	are required to	enable the <B>vm</B> utiltity.	Please
     see the <B>startall</B> command description for more information on the third
     and fourth	settings.

     Now run the <B>vm</B> <B>init</B> command to finish initialisation. This	will create
     subdirectories inside <I>$vm</I><B>_</B><I>dir</I> to hold configuration and templates.	It
     will also load any	required kernel	modules.  This command needs to	be run
     on	each boot, which is normally handled by	the rc.d script.

     Copy the sample templates into the	directory <I>$vm</I><B>_</B><I>dir/.templates/</I>.	You
     can create	and edit the templates as required. It is recommended to keep
     a template	called <I>default.conf</I>, as	this will be used when no template is
     manually specified.


</PRE>
<H2>ZFS</H2><PRE>
     If	you are	using a	ZFS dataset to store your virtual machines, and	want a
     new child dataset created for each	one, specify the dataset to use	in
     <I>/etc/rc.conf</I> as follows:

	   $vm_dir="zfs:pool/dataset"

     In	contrast to earlier versions, if <I>$vm</I><B>_</B><I>dir</I> is a normal path, a standard
     subdirectory will be created for each virtual machine, regardless of the
     file system type. However,	<B>vm</B> is now able to handle situations where the
     dataset mountpoint	does not match the dataset name.


</PRE>
<H2>QUICKSTART</H2><PRE>
     Create a virtual switch called <B>public</B> (which is the switch	name specified
     in	the default templates) and attach it to	a real interface.  Use your
     own interface in place of <B>em0</B> as required.

	  # vm switch create public
	  # vm switch add public em0

     Download an ISO file to use for installation:

	  # vm iso ftp://ftp.freebsd.org/pub/FreeBSD/releases/ISO-IMAGES/10.1/FreeBSD-10.1-RELEASE-amd64-disc1.iso

     Create a new guest	using the default template and disk size, then start
     the installation. The <I>install</I> subcommand will pause while the guest boot
     loader completes. Once successfully loaded, use the <I>console</I> command to
     complete the installation.

	  # vm create my-guest
	  # vm install my-guest	FreeBSD-10.1-RELEASE-amd64-disc1.iso
	  # vm console my-guest

     Please note that Linux guests currently require the <B>sysutils/grub2-bhyve</B>
     package to	be installed. (<font color=\"green\">NAS4Free have it</font>) This is use in place of <B>bhyveload(8)</B> to load the
     below.

     Once the installation ISO is ready, has been placed in the	<I>$vm</I><B>_</B><I>dir/.iso</I>
     directory,	and you	have the UEFI firmware,	installation can be performed
     as	normal.

	   # vm	create -t windows -s 30G winguest
	   # vm	install	winguest win_repack.iso

     Windows installation has been tested with 2012r2 and takes	around 20-25
     minutes.  During install, the guest will reboot twice (three runs in
     total). You can see the guest reboot by watching the log file
     <I>$vm</I><B>_</B><I>dir/guestname/vm-bhyve.log</I>.  The third	run should boot	fully into
     Windows. The <B>virtio</B> network adapter will request an IP address using
     DHCP. Connect to the guest	console	and press <B>i</B> to see the IP address that
     has been assigned.	The default unattended installation files should make
     RDP available, using Administrator	and Test123 as the default login
     details.

     The UEFI firmware (BHYVE_UEFI_20151002.fd), as well as instructions for
     creating an unattended installation ISO can currently be obtained from
     <I>https://people.freebsd.org/~grehan/bhyve</I><B>_</B><I>uefi/</I>


</PRE>
<H2>SUBCOMMANDS</H2><PRE>
     <B>init</B>
	     This should be run	once after each	host reboot before running any
	     other <B>vm</B> commands.	The main function of the <B>init</B> command is as
	     follows:

	     o Load all	necessary kernel modules if not	already	loaded
	     o Set tap devices to come up automatically	when opened
	     o Create any configured virtual switches

     <B>switch</B> <B>list</B>
	     List virtual switches. This reads all configured virtual switches
	     from the <I>$vm</I><B>_</B><I>dir/.config/switch</I> file and displays them. If	the
	     virtual switches are loaded, it also tries	to display the
	     <B>bridge(4)</B> interface that has been assigned	to each	one.

     <B>switch</B> <B>info</B> [<I>name</I>]
	     This command shows	detailed information about the specified vir-
	     tual switch.  If no switch	name is	provided, information is out-
	     put for all configured switches.  Information displayed includes
	     the following:

	     o Basic switch settings
	     o Overall bytes sent and received via this	switch
	     o Physical	ports connected
	     o Virtual ports, including	the associated virtual machine

     <B>switch</B> <B>create</B> <I>name</I>
	     Create a new virtual switch. The name must	be supplied and	may
	     Please note that this creates a 'manual' switch and is designed
	     to	allow you to configure your own	bridge.	None of	the <I>add</I>,
	     <I>remove</I>, <I>vlan</I> or <I>nat</I> commands are supported	on manual switches.

	     If	a manual switch	is destroyed using the <I>destroy</I> command,	we
	     remove all	vm-bhvye configuration,	but leave the <B>bridge(4)</B>	inter-
	     face intact.

     <B>switch</B> <B>vlan</B> <I>name</I> <I>vlan-id</I>
	     Assign a VLAN number to a virtual switch. The VLAN	number must be
	     between 0-4094.

	     When adding an interface to a VLAN	enabled	virtual	switch,	a new
	     <B>vlan(4)</B> interface is created. This	interface has the relevent
	     parent interface and VLAN tag configured. This vlan interface is
	     then added	to the virtual switch. As such,	all traffic between
	     guests on the same	switch is untagged and travels freely. How-
	     ever, all traffic exiting via physical interfaces is tagged.

	     If	the virtual switch already has physical	interfaces assigned,
	     they are all removed from the bridge, reconfigured, then re-
	     added.

	     To	remove the VLAN	configuration from a virtual switch, specify a
	     <I>vlan-id</I> of	0.

     <B>switch</B> <B>nat</B>	<I>name</I> <I>on|off</I>
	     Enable or disable NAT functionality on the	specified switch.
	     Please note that pf is required for this functionality and	must
	     be	enabled	in <I>/etc/rc.conf</I>.  If DHCP is desired, please install
	     the dnsmasq pacakge. vm-bhyve will	generate a sample dnsmasq con-
	     figuration	in <I>/usr/local/etc/dnsmasq.conf.bhyve</I>, but it is	up to
	     the user to either	use this configuration directly, or merge with
	     any existing dnsmasq settings you have configured.

	     The switch	should have no host ports assigned, as these will end
	     up	on the private side of the NAT network.	 <B>vm</B> automatically
	     detects the hosts default gateway,	which is used as the forward-
	     ing interface for NAT connections.

	     Once enabled, a 172.16.X.0/24 network is assigned to the switch
	     (bridge) interface.  <I>X</I> is chosen based on the ID of the bridge
	     interface.	For example, if	the switch is using bridge10, the net-
	     work will be 172.16.10.0/24.  dnsmasq can be used to provide DHCP
	     to	the guests, and	pf rules are inserted to provide the NAT
	     translation.

	     <I>/etc/pf.conf</I> is created if	it doesn't exist, and a	single include
	     statement is added. This include statement	can be moved within
	     the file if required.

     <B>switch</B> <B>add</B>	<I>name</I> <I>interface</I>
	     any <B>vlan(4)</B> interfaces if they are	not in use by other virtual
	     switches.

     <B>create</B> [<B>-t</B>	<I>template</I>] [<B>-s</B> <I>size</I>] <I>name</I>
	     Create a new virtual machine.

	     Unless specified, the <I>default.conf</I>	template will be used and a
	     20GB virtual disk image is	created. This command will created the
	     virtual machine directory <I>$vm</I><B>_</B><I>dir/$name</I>, and create the configu-
	     ration file and empty disk	image within.

	     <B>-t</B>	<I>template</I>   Specifies the template to use from within the
			   <I>$vm</I><B>_</B><I>dir/.templates</I> directory. The <B>.conf</B> suffix is
			   not required.

	     <B>-s</B>	<I>size</I>	   The size of disk image to create in GB. Unless
			   specified, the guest	image will be a	sparse file
			   20GB	in size.

     <B>destroy</B> <I>name</I>
	     Removes the specified virtual machine from	the system, deleting
	     all associated disk images	&amp; configuration.

     <B>list</B>
	     List all the virtual machines in the <I>$vm</I><B>_</B><I>dir</I> directory. This will
	     show the basic configuration for each virtual machine, and
	     whether they are currently	running.

     <B>info</B> [<I>name</I>]
	     Shows detailed information	about the specified virtual machine.
	     If	no name	is given, information for all virtual machines is dis-
	     played.

	     This output includes detailed information about network and disk
	     devices, including	the space usage	for all	virtual	disks (exlud-
	     ing custom	disk devices). If the guest is running,	the output
	     also shows	the amount of host memory curently in use, and addi-
	     tional network details including bytes sent/received for each
	     virtual interface.

     <B>install</B> <I>name</I> <I>iso</I>
	     Start a guest installation	for the	named virtual machine, using
	     the specified ISO file.  The <I>iso</I> argument should be the filename
	     of	an ISO file already downloaded into the	<I>$vm</I><B>_</B><I>dir/.iso</I> direc-
	     tory. ISO files in	this directory can be managed using the	<I>iso</I>
	     subcommand	described below.

	     Once started, the guest loader will be booted in the foreground.
	     This allows you to	choose the <B>Install</B> boot	option for guests that
	     require it. Once the loader has completed,	you will be returned
	     to	the shell and bhyve will continue running in the background.
	     Use the <I>console</I> subcommand	to connect to the guest	and complete
	     <B>tap(4)</B> interface will be created. If possible, the	tap interface
	     will be attached the relevent <B>bridge(4)</B> interface,	based on the
	     virtual switch specified in the guest configuration.

     <B>stop</B> <I>name</I>
	     Stop a named virtual machine. All <B>tap(4)</B> and <B>nmdm(4)</B> devices will
	     be	automatically cleaned up once the guest	has exited.

     <B>console</B> <I>name</I> [<I>com1|com2</I>]
	     Connect to	the console of the named virtual machine. Without net-
	     work access, this is the primary way of connecting	to the guest
	     once it is	running.

	     By	default	this will connect to the first com port	specified in
	     the client	configuration, which is	usually	com1. Alternatively
	     you can specify the com port to connect to.

	     This looks	for the	<B>nmdm(4)</B>	device associated with the virtual
	     machine, and connects to it with <B>cu(1)</B>.  Use ~+Ctrl-D to exit the
	     console and return	to the host.

     <B>rename</B> <I>name</I> <I>new-name</I>
	     Renames the specified virtual machine. The	guest must be stopped
	     to	use this function.

     <B>add</B> [<B>-d</B> <I>device</I>] [<B>-t</B> <I>type</I>] [<B>-s</B> <I>size|switch</I>]	<I>name</I>
	     Add a new network or disk device to the named virtual machine.
	     The options depend	on the type of device that is being added:

	     <B>-d</B>	<I>device</I>	      The type of device to add. Currently this	can
			      either be	<I>disk</I> or	<I>network</I>

	     <B>-t</B>	<I>type</I>	      For disk devices,	this specifies the type	of
			      disk device to create.  Valid options for	this
			      are <I>zvol</I>,	<I>sparse-zvol</I> and	<I>file</I>.  If not speci-
			      fied, this defaults to <I>file</I>.

	     <B>-s</B>	<I>size|switch</I>   For disk devices,	this is	used to	specify	the
			      size of the disk image to	create.	For network
			      devices, use this	option to specify the virtual
			      switch to	connect	the network interface to.

	     For both types of device, the emulation type will be chosen auto-
	     matically based on	the emulation used for the existing guest
	     devices.

     <B>reset</B> <I>name</I>
	     Forcefully	reset the named	virtual	machine. This can cause	cor-
	     ruption to	the guest file system just as with real	hardware and
	     should only be used if necessary.

     <B>poweroff</B> <I>name</I>
	     test/un-needed guests alone)

	     The delay between starting	guests can be set using	the <I>$vm</I><B>_</B><I>delay</I>
	     variable, which defaults to 5 seconds. Too	small a	delay can
	     cause problems, as	each guest doesn't have	enough time to claim a
	     null modem	device before the next guest starts. Increasing	this
	     value can be useful if you	have disk-intensive guests and want to
	     give each guest a chance to fully boot before the next starts.

     <B>stopall</B>
	     Stop all running virtual machines.	This sends a stop command to
	     all <B>bhyve(8)</B> instances, regardless	of whether they	were starting
	     using <B>vm</B> or not.

     <B>configure</B> <I>name</I>
	     The <B>configure</B> command simply opens	the virtual machine configura-
	     tion file in your default editor, allowing	you to easily make
	     changes. Please note, changes do not take effect until the	vir-
	     tual machine is fully shutdown and	restarted.

     <B>clone</B> <I>name</I>	<I>new-name</I>
	     Create a clone of the virtual machine <I>name</I>, as long as it is cur-
	     rently powered off. The new machine will be called	<I>new-name</I>, and
	     will be ready to boot with	a newly	assigned UUID and empty	log
	     file.

	     Please note that this function requires ZFS, and a	snapshot will
	     be	taken of the original guest, along with	any descendant
	     datasets.

     <B>snapshot</B> [<B>-f</B>] <I>name|name@snapshot</I>
	     Create a snapshot of the names virtual machine. This command is
	     only supported with ZFS and will take a snapshot of the guest
	     dataset and any descendent	ZVOL devices.

	     The guest and snapshot name can be	specified in the normal
	     <I>name@snapshot</I> way familiar	to ZFS users. If no snapshot name is
	     given, the	snapshot is based on the current timestamp in
	     <I>Y-m-d-H:M:S</I> format.

	     By	default	the guest must be stopped to use this command,
	     although you can force a snapshot of a running guest by using the
	     <B>-f</B>	option.

     <B>rollback</B> [<B>-r</B>] <I>name@snapshot</I>
	     Rollback the guest	to the specified snapshot. This	will roll back
	     the guest dataset and all descendent ZVOL devices.

	     Normally, ZFS will	only allow you to roll back to the most	recent
	     snapshot.	If the snapshot	given is not the most recent, ZFS will
	     produce a warning detailing that you need to use the <B>-r</B> option to
	     remove the	more recent snapshots. It will also produce a list of
	     List available images. Any	virtual	machine	can be packaged	into
	     an	image, which can then be used to create	additional machines.
	     All images	have a globally	unique ID (UUID) which is used to
	     identify them. The	list command shows the UUID, the original
	     machine name, the date it was created and a short description of
	     the image.

	     Please note that these commands rely on using ZFS featured	to
	     package/unpackage the images, and as such are only	available when
	     using a ZFS dataset as the	storage	location.

     <B>image</B> <B>create</B> [<B>-d</B> <I>description</I>] <I>name</I>
	     Create a new image	from the named virtual machine.	This will cre-
	     ate a compressed copy of the original guest dataset, which	is
	     stored in the <I>$vm</I><B>_</B><I>dir/images</I> directory. It	also creates a
	     <I>UUID.manifest</I> file	which contains details about the image.

	     Once complete, it will display the	UUID which has been assigned
	     to	this image.

     <B>image</B> <B>provision</B> <I>uuid</I> <I>new-name</I>
	     Create a new virtual machine, named <I>new-name</I>, from	the specified
	     image UUID.

     <B>image</B> <B>destroy</B> <I>uuid</I>
	     Destroy the specified image.


</PRE>
<H2>CONFIGURATION FORMAT</H2><PRE>
     Each virtual machine has a	configuration file that	specifies the hardware
     configuration. This uses a	similar	format to the <B>rc</B> files,	making them
     easy to edit by hand. The settings	for each guest are stored in
     <I>$vm</I><B>_</B><I>dir/$vm</I><B>_</B><I>name/$vm</I><B>_</B><I>name.conf</I>.  An overview of the available configura-
     tion options is listed below.

     guest		Specify	the type of guest to be	installed in this vir-
			tual machine. Current valid options for	this are
			generic, freebsd, netbsd, openbsd, windows, centos,
			ubuntu,	debian &amp; alpine	linux.

     uefi		Set this (any non-empty	value) for guests that need
			UEFI firmware.

     cpu		A numeric value	specifying the number of virtual CPU
			cores to assign	to the guest.

     memory		The amount of memory to	assign to the guest. This can
			be specified in	megabytes or gigabytes using the <B>M</B> and
			<B>G</B> suffixes.

     hostbridge		This option allows you to specify the type of host-
			bridge used for	the guest hardware.  Normally you can
			leave this as default, which is	to use a standard
     utctime		Set this option	to <B>yes</B> if the guest RTC	should keep
			UTC time.

     debug		If this	is set to <B>yes</B>, all output from the <B>bhyve(8)</B>
			process	will be	written	to <B>${vm_dir}/guest/bhyve.log</B>.
			This is	useful for debugging purposes as it allows you
			to see any error messages that are being produced by
			<B>bhyve(8)</B> itself.

     network0_type	The emulation to use for the first network adapter.
			This option can	be unspecified if no guest networking
			is required. The recommended value for this is
			<B>virtio-net</B>.  Additional	network	interfaces can be con-
			figured	by adding additional <B>networkX_type</B> and
			<B>networkX_switch</B>	values,	replacing <B>X</B> with the next
			available integer.

     network0_switch	The virtual switch to connect interface	<B>0</B> to. This
			should correspond to a virtual switch created using
			the <I>vm</I> <I>switch</I> <I>create</I> subcommand. If the	virtual	switch
			is not found, an interface will	still be assigned, but
			not connected to any bridge.

			Note that this field is	no longer strictly required.
			If you are using a custom device for the networking
			that is	already	configured, you	may not	need the
			interface connected to a virtual switch. See the
			<B>network0_device</B>	configuration option.

     network0_device	Normally vm-bhyve will create a	<B>tap(4)</B> device at run-
			time for each virtual network interface. This may be
			an issue in more advanced configurations where you
			want to	pre-configure the networking manually in a way
			unsupported by vm-bhyve. This option allows you	to
			instruct vm-bhyve to use an existing network device
			for this virtual interface, rather than	creating one
			dynamically.

     network0_mac	This option allows you to specify a mac	address	to use
			for this interface. If not provided, <B>bhyve(8)</B> will
			generate a mac address.

     disk0_type		The emulation type for the first virtual disk. At
			least one virtual disk is required.  Valid options for
			this are currently <B>virtio-blk</B> and <B>ahci-hd</B>.  Additional
			disks can be added by adding additional	<B>diskX_type</B> and
			<B>diskX_name</B> values, replacing <B>X</B> with the	next available
			integer.

     disk0_name		The filename for the first virtual disk. The first
			disk is	created	automatically when provisioning	a new
			virtual	machine. If additional disks are added manu-
			which will used	a ZVOL as the disk image, created
			directly under the guest dataset.  Alternatively you
			can specify <B>custom</B>, in which case <I>diskX</I><B>_</B><I>name</I> should be
			the full path to the image file	or device.

     disk0_opts		Any additional options to use for this disk device.
			Multiple options can be	specified, separated by	a
			comma. Please see the <B>bhyve(8)</B> man page	for more
			details	on supported options.

     uuid		This option allows you to specify a fixed UUID for the
			guests SMBIOS. Normally, the UUID is generated by
			<B>bhyve(8)</B> based on the hostname and guest name. Because
			this may change	if guests are moved between systems,
			the <I>vm</I> <I>create</I> command automatically assigns a UUID to
			all newly created guests.

     passthruX		Specify	a device to pass through to the	guest. You
			will need to reserve the device	first so that is it
			claimed	by the ppt driver on boot.

			Once the device	is successfully	reserved, you can add
			it to the guest	by adding <B>passthruX="1/2/3"</B> to the
			guest configuration file, where	<B>X</B> is an	integer	start-
			ing at 0, and <B>1/2/3</B> is the Base/Slot/Function of the
			device.	If you are passing through multiple functions
			on the same device, make sure they are specified
			together in the	configuration file in the same
			sequence as the	original device.

			Please see https://wiki.freebsd.org/bhyve/pci_passthru
			for more details on how	this works.

     virt_random	Set this option	to <B>yes</B> if you want to create a
			<B>virtio-rnd</B> device for this guest.

     grub_commands	Sometimes you may need to provide grub commands	that
			differ from those generated by <I>vm-bhyve</I>.  In this
			case, create a text file inside	the guest's directory
			containing the commands	you need to run. Usually the
			last entry in the file should be <I>boot</I>, followed	by a
			newline. The newline is	important, otherwise the last
			command	may not	actually be executed.

			Once you have created the file,	set this option	to the
			name of	the file. From that point on, during a normal
			boot <I>vm-bhyve</I> will use the commands from this file
			rather than attempting to generate them	automatically.

     zfs_dataset_opts	This allows you	to specify one or more ZFS properties
			to set on the dataset when a guest is created. Because
			properties are assigned	as the dataset is created,
			ation time.

			Multiple properties can	be specified, separated	by a
			space. For example, the	following will configure the
			ZVOL block size	to 128k, and turn compression off.

			zfs_zvol_opts="volblocksize=128k compress=off"

     linux_kernel	CentOS guests require the kernel to be loaded inside
			the boot loader. This option is	required for these
			guests and specifies the kernel	version	number to
			load. Hopefully	this requirement will be relaxed as
			<B>bhyve(8)</B> development continues.
